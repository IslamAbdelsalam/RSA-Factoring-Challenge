# RSA Encryption and Decryption

## Overview

This README file provides a brief introduction and usage guide for RSA encryption and decryption. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem for secure communication and data protection. It is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers and modular arithmetic.

## Prerequisites

To use RSA encryption and decryption, you will need:

1. A programming environment or software library that supports RSA encryption and decryption. Common choices include programming languages like Python, Java, or libraries like OpenSSL.

2. Basic knowledge of number theory and modular arithmetic.

3. A clear understanding of the RSA algorithm and its security considerations.

## Key Generation

RSA uses two keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. Key generation involves the following steps:

1. Choose two large prime numbers, p and q.
2. Calculate their product, n = p * q.
3. Compute the totient of n, φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1).
4. Select a public exponent, typically e, that is relatively prime to φ(n).
5. Calculate the private exponent, d, such that (d * e) % φ(n) = 1.
6. The public key consists of (n, e), while the private key is (n, d).

Key generation is typically done using cryptographic libraries, so you don't have to perform these calculations manually.

## Encryption

To encrypt a message (plaintext), use the recipient's public key. Here's how encryption works:

1. Convert the plaintext message into a numerical value m.
2. Calculate the ciphertext c = m^e % n, where e is the recipient's public exponent, and n is the modulus.
3. The ciphertext c is the encrypted message.

## Decryption

To decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original plaintext, use the recipient's private key. Here's how decryption works:

1. Obtain the ciphertext c.
2. Calculate the plaintext message m = c^d % n, where d is the recipient's private exponent, and n is the modulus.
3. Convert the numerical value m back into the original plaintext.

## Usage

To use RSA encryption and decryption:

1. Generate a key pair (public and private keys) using a cryptographic library or tool.

2. Share the public key with anyone who needs to send you encrypted messages.

3. Keep the private key secure and do not share it with anyone.

4. To encrypt a message for someone with your public key, use the recipient's public key and the encryption algorithm.

5. To decrypt a message encrypted with your public key, use your private key and the decryption algorithm.

## Security Considerations

RSA is a secure cryptosystem when used with sufficiently long keys (e.g., 2048 bits or more). However, there are several security considerations to keep in mind:

1. Key length: Longer keys are more secure but require more computational resources for encryption and decryption.

2. Key management: Safeguard your private key and use secure key storage mechanisms.

3. Randomness: Ensure that prime number generation and key generation processes use true randomness to prevent vulnerabilities.

4. Padding: Use proper padding schemes (e.g., PKCS#1 v1.5 or OAEP) to enhance security.

5. Key rotation: Periodically update your keys to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

6. Cryptographic libraries: Use well-established cryptographic libraries to implement RSA securely.
